    <h1>Battle Gameplay</h1>

    <p>Similar to Pokemon but you have HS mana as stamina. Every round you are gaining mana, but you are starting around 1-2 mana per monster. </p>

    <h2>Axes of game design : <b>Degrees of Freedom*</b></h2>

    <h3>Hard Designs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Base Stats [HP,ATK,SPATK,DEF,SPDEF,SPEED] : <b>2</b></u></li>
      <dd>Idea for names: [Health, Strength, Intelligence, Body, Mind, Agility], Can be tuned with an EV equivalent, but is faster than other game training</dd>
      <li><u>Typings : <b>2</b></u></li>
      <dd>Enough to create uneven-ness in the type matrix.</dd>
      <li><u>Stamina base, Stamina Gain : <b>2</b></u> </li>
      <dd>Max Stamina should range from 5-10ish? Stamina Gain should be 0-2 per turn</dd>
      <li><u>Abilities : <b>5</b></u> </li>
      <dd>Really defines a monster and how to utilize it.</dd>
      <li><u>Moves : <b>3</b></u></li>
      <dd>More variety with Stamina now. Powerful sttacks with high stamina to offset being able to use them asap.</dd>
    </ul>
    <p><sub>* Degrees of freedom [0-5] refers to the amount of impact the precieved axis will be designed to have on the gameplay. The higher the numnber, the higher the impact.</sub></p>

      <li>Some Abilities</li>
      <li>Actions During the Turn submitted blind</li>
      <li>Blind Pick Team? NO BANS... unless</li>
