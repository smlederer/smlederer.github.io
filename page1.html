  <h1>Battle Gameplay</h1>

  <p>Similar to Pokemon but you have HS mana as stamina. Every round you are gaining mana, but you are starting around 1-2 mana per monster. </p>

  <h2>Axes of game design : <b>Degrees of Freedom*</b></h2>

  <h3>Hard Designs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><u>Base Stats [HP,ATK,SPATK,DEF,SPDEF,SPEED] : <b>2</b></u></li>
    <dd>Can be tuned with an EV equivalent</dd>
    <li><u>Typings : <b>2</b></u></li>
    <dd>Enough to create uneven-ness in the type matrix.</dd>
    <li><u>Stamina base, Stamina Gain : <b>2</b></u> </li>
    <dd>Max Stamina should range from 5-10ish? Stamina Gain should be 0-2 per turn</dd>
    <li><u>Abilities : <b>5</b></u> </li>
    <dd>Really defines a monster and how to utilize it.</dd>
    <li><u>Moves : <b>3</b></u></li>
    <dd>More variety with Stamina now. Powerful sttacks with high stamina to offset being able to use them asap.</dd>
  </ul>
  <p><sub>* Degrees of freedom [0-5] refers to the amount of impact the precieved axis will be designed to have on the gameplay. The higher the numnber, the higher the impact.</sub></p>
